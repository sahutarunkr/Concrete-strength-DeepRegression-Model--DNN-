# Concrete-strength-DeepRegression Model (DNN)
In industrial practice Concrete's compressive strength is calculated using empirical methods using tables and charts.
It is an attempt to find realtion between compressive strenth and the composition materials, factors related to curing process.

## Factors taken in consideration: 
Cement wt, Slag amount, FlyAsh amount, Water, SuperPlasticizers, Coarse Aggregate, Fine Aggregate, and Age of Curing
